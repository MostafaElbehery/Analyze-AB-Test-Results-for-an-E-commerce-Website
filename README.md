# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results-for-an-E-commerce-Website

## Project overview:
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Advanced Data Analyst Nanodegree certification. A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that we get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Findings:
- $P_{value}$ > $P_{\alpha}$. (Type I Error = $\alpha$ = 0.05)
- ab_page is not statistically significant to predict conversion.
- country is not statistically significant in predict conversion.
- so according to all of this The old page is have higher convertion rate.
- So our suggesion is to keep the old webpage.
